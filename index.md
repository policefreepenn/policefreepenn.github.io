  <p>Police Free Penn is a coalition of Penn-affiliated community members working towards an abolitionist future. Taking inspiration from the demands of the Black Philly Radical Collective, our aim is to abolish Penn's ties to the prison industrial complex and to transform community safety within and beyond our institution. The group was created in June 2020, demanding that Penn must defund and disband its armed campus police, the largest private police department in Pennsylvania. Through research, direct action, and education, we are fighting for accountability and a Police Free Future.</p>

  <p>Take our survey which focuses on relationships with campus police in West Philadelphia: <a href="bit.ly/policefreepennsurvey">Survey</a>.</p>
